I am Yinuo Ma, a research assistant aiming to understand biological actions especially Biomacromolecules interactions and interconnections in biological Multi-Omics with computational methods. I grew up and got my bachelor and master degree in China. Currently, I serve as a research assistant in professor Li’s lab at Zhejiang University in China.

1. In biological processes, changes spanning from genomics to transcriptomics and ultimately to metabolomics exhibit corresponding relationships. However, due to the highly complex nature of biological systems, it is challenging to intuitively discern the underlying patterns across these multi-omics datasets. Therefore, deep learning-based approaches can help establish correspondence between these interconnected variations. I aim to develop a deep network-based method to facilitate the elucidation of regulatory patterns within multi-omics data across biological systems during my RA work period.

2. Aptamer is a functional single strand DNA/RNA which has specific affinity to target protein or biomolecule. But traditional SELEX has several problems for aptamer candidates choosing. So I built a method called DGFE-SELEX to improve the traditional SELEX with deep generative model as part of my mater research.
