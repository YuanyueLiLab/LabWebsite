I am Yuanyue Li, a bioinformatics scientist with a passion for understanding the molecular mechanisms of life by combining experimental and computational methods. I hope my research can help to answer those questions: 1) How many different molecules are there in a cell? 2) How do they interact with each other? 3) How do they work together to make a cell functional?

Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for measuring molecules with high sensitivity and accuracy. Therefore, I use mass spectrometry as my primary tool to measure molecules. I have developed serval methods to maximize the capabilities of mass spectrometry in life science research. Feel free to visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/YuanyueLi) page to try out the tools I've developed.

I grew up and received my doctoral degree in China, then enjoyed several years working in Germany and United States. Currently, I am working at Zhejiang University in China as an independent PI. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the world with my wife and our two daughters.

I am actively seeking talented research assistants, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to join my lab. If you are interested in my research, please do not hesitate to send my an Email, I look forward to hearing from you!
